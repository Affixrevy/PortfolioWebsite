Get Your Lord On is an annual event at Strathcona High school were students get together in team building exercises to meet and get to know each-other and the school. It also gives a chance, early every year for the media team to work together in both live production and video creation environments.

Part of GYLO was the big screen broadcast where live big screen magnification and pre-produced videos would be shown to better the experience of the show. Further, we would get to know the gear and the people we would be working hand in hand with for the rest of the year.

Finally to recap GYLO, footage from the preparation and the event was cut into a short video that would amplify school spirit.

Since I attended GYLO two years in a row, there are two videos from the event.

### GYLO 2019
GYLO 2019 was in my grade twelve year. At this point, I had firmly rooted myself as one of the lead producers of the media team. The media production of GYLO 2019 was largely directed by me, from artistic direction, to resource allocation. The event allowed me to learn to manage a large team effectively in a high pressure situation while ensuring a high quality product was delivered--both in the video work for the recap, and the live production elements.

### GYLO 2018
At this event, I was just establishing myself as a member of the media team, getting to know the people and the equipment. I filmed some of the video and assisted in the editing and helped in constructing the storyline of the video.
