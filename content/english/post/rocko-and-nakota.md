Rocko and Nakota was my first experience in theatre production and opened me up to another world of video. I got to experience the masterful storytelling of playwright and performer Josh Languedoc. We worked hand in hand to transition the show to an online nature to accommodate the pandemic creating a beautiful stream that captured and entertained the audience for the running time.

Rocko and Nakota was ultimately streamed live to an audience of over 3500 people at the peak on June 22, 2021.
