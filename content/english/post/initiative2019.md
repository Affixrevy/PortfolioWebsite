The Scona Initiative is a yearly event at Strathcona High School where the student base unites in support of a chosen charity, fundraising, and raising money as they ultimately built up to the final celebrationâ€”Bikeathon.

This video documents the fundraising, and the interactions with the community in the lead-up to Bikeathon and is a recap of the events of Bikeathon. I filmed a significant portion of the bikeathon part and edited the latter third of the video.
