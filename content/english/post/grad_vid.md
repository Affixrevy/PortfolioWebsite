The 2021 Strathcona High School grad video presented a unique opportunity for me to showcase everything I had learned in making videos by making a memorable piece for the class of 2021. I had originally joined the schools volunteer media team in my grade 11 year in 2018 and quickly became an integral part of it, capturing video of the never-ending school events in both my grade 11 and grade 12 years. Passing the torch on, other media members continued in the 2020-21 school year.

The media team were approached in May about the possibility of such a video, as they knew that all footage of the studentsâ€™ three years in high school had been archived and kept. As I had kept in contact with the members of the team after graduating, they approached me, asking for my help. Excited, we created a video detailing the excitement and bustling community surrounding the school pre-covid and captured the essence of a covid graduation.

The challenges surrounding this video stemmed from the very tight turn-around time with the final section, showing the actual graduation, which was edited in under 18 hours given the set video release time and the final stage crossing of the graduation.
