Welcome week at Scona is always an exciting time where students gather and meet each other while enjoying various celebrations. This video aimed to capture the essence of the festivities, from the new grade tens just rooting themselves in the school and getting the first taste of the school culture to the grade twelves excited to go out with a bang! 

The rapid nature of the first week of school allowed us to capture and bottle the excitement in a short little video that excited the community and prepared everyone for another event ladened year at Scona.
