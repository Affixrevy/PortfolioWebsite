The Scona Initiative is a yearly event at Strathcona High School where the student base unites in support of a chosen charity, fundraising, and raising money as they ultimately built up to the final celebration—Bikeathon.

This video documents the process of choosing the charity, fundraising, and the build-up to Bikeathon and explores the impact to the school community as Bikethon was ultimately cancelled by the covid-19 pandemic.

As the video was created in the initial days of the covid pandemic, we attempted to capture the impact it had had on the high school student’s life, while still recognizing the incredible fundraising done before the pandemic. Ultimately the video was made to be a celebration of the incredible work of the Scona community in supporting those in need.
