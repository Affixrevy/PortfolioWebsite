The ARC180 course allowed me to view computation and its uses in a new light. I had always loved design and computing but never had the opportunity to put both passions together. The ARC180 course gave me an environment where that was possible. Beginning in the [Processing]() language, we learned how to use the computational power of computers as well as randomness to create parametric art. Moving on we used [Grasshopper]() in [Rhino 7]() to take what we learned in parametric design and put it in a architecture context.

### Processing Design Project
I realized, after looking for some inspiration online, that it was possible to simulate the look of the moon by using lines on a defined arc and connecting these thin lines to create a pseudo-moon.
