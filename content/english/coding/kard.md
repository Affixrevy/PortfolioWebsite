The kard project gave me an opportunity to further developed my leadership skills. Given that the project spanned the whole semester, the group members had to work synchronously on a defined schedule. Initially, the project proved difficult as each group member was busy and focused solely on their part of the program at their own pace and schedule. I stepped up and actively and regularly communicated with the team members so that they were aware of their responsibilities. I ensured that due dates were appropriately met and kept track of the group activities toward project completion. 

Under my leadership, each group member became a more active and aware contributor and completed their work much more efficiently. Each member also communicated more frequently and effectively about their current and planned work. The improved communication, coupled with the usage of GitHub features to keep track of our work, united the team members. It not only successfully prevented the group members from working on the same feature on different branches, but also made merging branches much more seamless as each member was already aware and communicated how their part of the program would fit like a piece in the whole project. Our group's efforts were recognized with a final mark of 95% from the TA and praise from Professor Greis. After our final presentation, the group members showed their gratitude for how I brought the project together to create a cohesive and successful semester project.

The kard project involved numerous different parts with a SQLite database, Java backend running the Spring Webserver Framework, Java command line client application, and a Flutter user interface. I managed and coordinated the development of all aspects of the app and personally developed most of the Flutter user interface.
