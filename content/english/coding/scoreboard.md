The Scona Scoreboard Software is a suite of software that connected the existing (name) scoreboard in the gymnasium to a score bug that we overlayed on the live broadcast. 

The project involved developing, designing, and animating the score bug in Processing, interpreting and reading the serial signal from the scoreboard, and developing ways for the reading program to communicate with the score bug.
