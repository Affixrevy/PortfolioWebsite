Grad 2021

The 2021 Strathcona High School grad video presented a unique opportunity for me to showcase everything I had learned in making videos by making a memorable piece for the class of 2021. I had originally joined the schools volunteer media team in my grade 11 year in 2018 and quickly became an integral part of it, capturing video of the never-ending school events in both my grade 11 and grade 12 years. Passing the torch on, other media members continued in the 2020-21 school year.

 

The media team were approached in May about the possibility of such a video, as they knew that all footage of the students’ three years in high school had been archived and kept. As I had kept in contact with the members of the team after graduating, they approached me, asking for my help. Excited, we created a video detailing the excitement and bustling community surrounding the school pre-covid and captured the essence of a covid graduation.

 

The challenges surrounding this video stemmed from the very tight turn-around time with the final section, showing the actual graduation, which was edited in under 18 hours given the set video release time and the final stage crossing of the graduation. 

 

 

Initiative 2020

The Scona Initiative is a yearly event at Strathcona High School where the student base unites in support of a chosen charity, fundraising, and raising money as they ultimately built up to the final celebration—Bikeathon.

 

This video documents the process of choosing the charity, fundraising, and the build-up to Bikeathon and explores the impact to the school community as Bikethon was ultimately cancelled by the covid-19 pandemic.

 

As the video was created in the initial days of the covid pandemic, we attempted to capture the impact it had had on the high school student’s life, while still recognizing the incredible fundraising done before the pandemic. Ultimately the video was made to be a celebration of the incredible work of the Scona community in supporting those in need.

 

Welcome Week 2019

Welcome week at Scona is always an exciting time where students gather and meet each other while enjoying various celebrations. This video aimed to capture the essence of the celebration, from the new grade tens just rooting themselves in the school and getting the first taste of the school culture to the grade twelves excited to go out with a bang! 

 

The rapid nature of the first week of school allowed for us to capture and bottle the excitement in a short little video that excited the community and prepared everyone for another event ladened year at Scona.

This video documents the fundraising, and the interactions with the community in the lead up to Bikeathon and is a reacap of the events of Bikeathon. I filmed a significant portion of the bikeathon part and edited the latter third of the video.

 

Rocko and Nakota

Rocko and Nakota was my first experience in theatre production and opened me up to another world of video. I got to experience the masterful storytelling of playwright and performer Josh Languedoc. We worked hand in hand to transition the show to an online nature to accommodate the pandemic creating a beautiful show that captured and entertained the audience for the running time.

 

Rocko and Nakota was ultimately streamed live to an audience of over 3500 people at the peak on June 22, 2021.
